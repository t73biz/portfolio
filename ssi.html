On April 24th, 2015 I was awarded disability status from a federal judge in Chicago Il. I have still not recieved any of my backpay for my disability filling and for widowers disability.
I have been in contact with Annette Galligan - District Manager in Oshkosh Office (ext 14900), on several occassions to try and resolve this matter.
In the beginning of October 2015, I had spoken with Annette G., and she informed me that the local office in Oshkosh WI, had finished their calculations and would be forwarding it to the Chicago Processing Center for dispersement. She informed me at that time, that I should have it by November 14th, 2015.
I spoke with Annette G. today, November 13th 2015, about this matter and have come to a understanding that our Social Security Administration System is broken.
Annette G. informed me today that she could send a message electronically (not email), to the "module" management that was assigned the case.
Annette G. also informed me that she has no way of confirming that the message was ever read or complied with. This seems very ineffective and careless.
Annette G. informed me that she could see that the issue had been forwarded on October 14th, 2015 and that it had been pulled from backlog on November 3rd.
Annette G. told me that I should wait another 3 weeks potentially and check back on December 3rd.
The process for this seems slow and antiquated. Surely with all of the technology available today, there must be a faster solution. I know that I am not the only one having this issue, as my case was in backlog with other persons.
I am writing this to ask you to help expedite this, not only for me, but for other persons as well.
